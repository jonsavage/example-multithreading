Simple Multi Threading example

This is just a simple example of a multiThreaded Application. The first example is a proof of concept to show that we can fire off 2 threads and have them 
finish in not-the-same order. The seconf example shows that we can speed up a batch of stupid-long 3 way array copies by splitting 
logical tasks over seperate threads.
